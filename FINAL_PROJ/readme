Program: findName
Version: 1.1
Created: 9/27/19
Revised: 10/1/19
Files: findName.cpp, findName.sh, Makefile, readme
Programmer: Samuel Dunny
Course: CSCE-215
Assignment: Final Project
Compiler: GNU Gcc version 4.2.3
Target: Linux

Description:

        This program allows the user to search a username in the CSCE-215 database for the
        Fall of 2019, and implements a cpp program

Revisions:

        This entire project was a major revision.
        Rev. 10/2/19 14.38: fixed issue where the findName.cpp wouldn't return an error if
                            too many arguments were input

Constants and Variables:

        shell script findName.sh

Instructions for Use:

        ```
        $ tar xvf $USER.findname.tar
        $ make
        $ ./findName someuserid
        ```

Expected Results:

        This program will have one of three results
        1: outputs the correct username
        2: returns an error if the user is not found
        3: returns an error if the input arguments arent valid

        The "Instructions for Use" should open the tar file, make a new findName program,
        and should return one of the 3 options listed above
